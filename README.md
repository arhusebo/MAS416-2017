## MAS416 - Autumn 2017

Solutions to weekly tasks in Python 3 because MATLAB is proprietary and Jukebox is useless.

Uses matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org) for plotting functionality.

I will try my best to comment the solutions, but I am a lazy person so don't expect too much :) If there are any errors, please feel free to report them.
